PROJECTS & OPEN SOURCE CONTRIBUTIONS
Finn has created and worked on a wide variety of personal projects and open-source projects like:
- ToneIn was a project Finn and a team of 3 others built with Python, the Slack API, the Open AI API. ToneIn was Slack extension that uses machine learning and data collection to educate users on the tone of their work and personal environments. Won first place at the University of Cincinnati’s RevolutionUC Major League Hacking sponsored hackathon, beating 50 other teams. 
- The SSDT Slack Bot was a project Finn built with Golang and the Slack API. It was a a Slack Bot created to manage the GitHub workflow for 10+ members of a software development team and send automatic reminders. This allowed users to get started on work immediately when they start their shifts instead of having to figure out and coordinate what they need to work. This saved each person about 30+ minutes of setup each shift.
- The CELTS Link Application was a project built by the SSDT using Python, JavaScript, Flask, HTML and CSS. Finn contributed 4000+ lines and completed 70+ issues on GitHub to the open source CELTS Link application developed by the Student Software Development Team. Created CI/CD pipelines with GitHub Actions to automatically test and deploy code that allowed users to focus on their work instead of testing their code saving them about 15 minutes, increasing productivity, and increasing the amount of code that is tested.
- Rex is a social media IOS app Finn built on his own with SwiftUI and Firebase Firestore. Developed a social media mobile application using Swift and Firebase Firestore that allows users to send, receive, and post recommendations to their friends and others. Built a full user authentication program and multi-page IOS app.
- This website, Finn's Personal Portfolio website was a project he built from scratch with NextJS, Python, FastAPI, and the OpenAI API. Finn built this project from scratch to allow anyone to view his experience and information in an informative way. He utilized OpenAI and Python to send requests from NextJS to the FastAPI backend to allow users to interact with a chat bot informed about all of his information.
